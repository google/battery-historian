# Battery Historian

Battery Historian is a tool to inspect battery related information and events on an Android device running Android 5.0 Lollipop (API level 21) and later, while the device was not plugged in. It allows application developers to visualize system and application level events on a timeline with panning and zooming functionality, easily see various aggregated statistics since the device was last fully charged, and select an application and inspect the metrics that impact battery specific to the chosen application. It also allows an A/B comparison of two bugreports, highlighting differences in key battery related metrics.

## Getting Started

#### Using Docker

Install [Docker](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>).

Run the Battery Historian image. Choose a port number and replace `<port>` with
that number in the commands below:

```
docker -- run -p <port>:9999 gcr.io/android-battery-historian:2.1 --port 9999
```

For Linux and Mac OS X:

* That's it, you're done! Historian will be available at
  `http://localhost:<port>`.

For Windows:

* You may have to [enable Virtualization in your
  BIOS](<http://www.itworld.com/article/2981515/virtualization/virtualbox-diagnose-and-fix-vt-xamd-v-hardware-acceleration-errors.html>).

* Once you start Docker, it should tell you the IP address of the machine it is
using. If, for example, the IP address is 123.45.67.89, Historian will be
available at `http://123.45.67.89:<port>`.

For more information about the port forwarding, see the [Docker
documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#/expose-incoming-ports).

#### Building from source code

If you are new to the Go programming language:

* Follow the instructions available at <http://golang.org/doc/install> for downloading and installing the Go compilers, tools, and libraries.
* Create a workspace directory according to the instructions at
  <http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Organization>.
* Ensure that `GOPATH` and `GOBIN` environment variables are appropriately set and added to your `$PATH`
  environment variable. `$GOBIN should be set to $GOPATH/bin`.
  * For Windows, you may set environment variables through the "Environment Variables" button on the
  "Advanced" tab of the "System" control panel. Some versions of Windows provide this control panel
  through the "Advanced System Settings" option inside the "System" control panel.
  * For Linux and Mac OS X, you can add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc or
    ~/.profile files (assuming your workspace is $HOME/work):

      ```
      export GOPATH=$HOME/work
      export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
      export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
      ```

Next, install Git from <https://git-scm.com/downloads> if it's not already installed.

Next, make sure Python 2.7 (NOT Python 3!) is installed. See <https://python.org/downloads>
if it isn't, and ensure that python is added to your `$PATH` environment variable.

Next, install Java from <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>.

Next, download the Battery Historian code and its dependencies:

```
$ go get -d -u github.com/google/battery-historian/...
```

Finally, run Battery Historian!

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/google/battery-historian

# Compile Javascript files using the Closure compiler
$ go run setup.go

# Run Historian on your machine (make sure $PATH contains $GOBIN)
$ go run cmd/battery-historian/battery-historian.go [--port <default:9999>]
```

Remember, you must always run battery-historian from inside the `$GOPATH/src/github.com/google/battery-historian` directory:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/google/battery-historian
go run cmd/battery-historian/battery-historian.go [--port <default:9999>]
```


#### How to take a bug report

To take a bug report from your Android device, you will need to enable USB debugging under `Settings > System > Developer Options`. On Android 4.2 and higher, the Developer options screen is hidden by default. You can enable this by following the instructions [here](<http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html#Enabling>).

To obtain a bug report from your development device running Android 7.0 and
higher:

```
$ adb bugreport bugreport.zip
```

For devices 6.0 and lower:

```
$ adb bugreport > bugreport.txt
```

### Start analyzing!

You are all set now. Run `historian` and visit <http://localhost:9999> and
upload the `bugreport.txt` file to start analyzing.

## Screenshots

##### Timeline:

![Timeline](/screenshots/timeline.png "Timeline Visualization")

##### System stats:

![System](/screenshots/system.png "Aggregated System statistics since the device was last fully charged")

##### App stats:

![App](/screenshots/app.png "Application specific statistics")

## Advanced

To reset aggregated battery stats and history:

```
adb shell dumpsys batterystats --reset
```

##### Wakelock analysis

By default, Android does not record timestamps for application-specific
userspace wakelock transitions even though aggregate statistics are maintained
on a running basis. If you want Historian to display detailed information about
each individual wakelock on the timeline, you should enable full wakelock
reporting using the following command before starting your experiment:

```
adb shell dumpsys batterystats --enable full-wake-history
```

Note that by enabling full wakelock reporting the battery history log overflows
in a few hours. Use this option for short test runs (3-4 hrs).

##### Kernel trace analysis

To generate a trace file which logs kernel wakeup source and kernel wakelock
activities:

First, connect the device to the desktop/laptop and enable kernel trace logging:

```
$ adb root
$ adb shell

# Set the events to trace.
$ echo "power:wakeup_source_activate" >> /d/tracing/set_event
$ echo "power:wakeup_source_deactivate" >> /d/tracing/set_event

# The default trace size for most devices is 1MB, which is relatively low and might cause the logs to overflow.
# 8MB to 10MB should be a decent size for 5-6 hours of logging.

$ echo 8192 > /d/tracing/buffer_size_kb

$ echo 1 > /d/tracing/tracing_on
```

Then, use the device for intended test case.

Finally, extract the logs:

```
$ echo 0 > /d/tracing/tracing_on
$ adb pull /d/tracing/trace <some path>

# Take a bug report at this time.
$ adb bugreport > bugreport.txt
```

Note:

Historian plots and relates events in real time (PST or UTC), whereas kernel
trace files logs events in jiffies (seconds since boot time). In order to relate
these events there is a script which approximates the jiffies to utc time. The
script reads the UTC times logged in the dmesg when the system suspends and
resumes. The scope of the script is limited to the amount of timestamps present
in the dmesg. Since the script uses the dmesg log when the system suspends,
there are different scripts for each device, with the only difference being
the device-specific dmesg log it tries to find. These scripts have been
integrated into the Battery Historian tool itself.

##### Powermonitor analysis

Powermonitor files should have the following format per line:

```
<timestamp in epoch seconds> <amps>
```

Entries from the powermonitor file will be overlaid on top of the timeline plot.

To ensure the powermonitor and bug report timelines are somewhat aligned,
please reset the batterystats before running any powermonitor logging:

```
adb shell dumpsys batterystats --reset
```

And take a bug report soon after stopping powermonitor logging.

If using a Monsoon:

Download the AOSP Monsoon Python script from <https://android.googlesource.com/platform/cts/+/master/tools/utils/monsoon.py>

```
# Run the script.
$ monsoon.py --serialno 2294 --hz 1 --samples 100000 -timestamp | tee monsoon.out

# ...let device run a while...

$ stop monsoon.py
```

##### Modifying the proto files

If you want to modify the proto files (pb/\*/\*.proto), first download the
additional tools necessary:

Install the standard C++ implementation of protocol buffers from <https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/README.md>

Download the Go proto compiler:

```
$ go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
```

The compiler plugin, protoc-gen-go, will be installed in $GOBIN, which must be
in your $PATH for the protocol compiler, protoc, to find it.

Make your changes to the proto files.

Finally, regenerate the compiled Go proto output files using `regen_proto.sh`.

##### Other command line tools

# System stats
$ go run cmd/checkin-parse/local_checkin_parse.go --input=bugreport.txt

# Timeline analysis
$ go run cmd/history-parse/local_history_parse.go --summary=totalTime --input=bugreport.txt

# Diff two bug reports
